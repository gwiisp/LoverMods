# LoverMods

**LoverMods** is a feature-rich companion mod built to enhance the overall **LoverCraft** experience all the way from farming to trading. It brings together quality-of-life, cosmetic and informational features that make gameplay smoother, clearer and more rewarding, all without breaking the vanilla balance.

## Key Features

* **Skin Trading Enhancements** – When trading or browsing skins, simply hover over an item to instantly see its price. No more guessing or tabbing out LoverMods gives you the info you need right in-game.
* **Integrated FarmerAddons** – The beloved **FarmerAddons** mod will be fully ported into LoverMods, bringing its farming-focused quality-of-life tools like the *Netherwart Highlight* and other visual farming aids.
* **Unified Experience** – Instead of managing multiple mods, LoverMods centralizes these cosmetic and utility features under one optimized package.

## Philosophy

LoverMods is **not a cheat mod** it’s focused purely on visual and informational improvements that enhance your experience without altering game mechanics or providing unfair advantages. Every feature is designed to help players enjoy LoverCraft’s systems to the fullest, while keeping gameplay fair and balanced.

## Compatibility

* Built for the **LoverCraft** server and ecosystem
* Client-side only — no impact on server performance or gameplay
* Works seamlessly alongside other visual or utility mods

## Future Plans

LoverMods will continue to grow with new modules, starting with **FarmerAddons integration**, **skin trading utilities**, and more visual tools for mining, building, and trading. Each feature will stay true to the mod’s philosophy: *useful, fair, and immersive*.
